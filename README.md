# Fuel Rats

## Concept

All vehicles are spawned at the same time. A single `canister` and a `goal` are created during a round. During a round the `canister` must be taken to the `goal`. The `canister` can be stolen from the `canister` holder by bumping the front of your vehicle into the `canister holder`.

Upon bringing the `canister` to the goal a point is given to the player and a new round will begin.

## Scope

```
- Select Car Color, Neon, etc.
- 1 Car Type Randomly Per Matchup
- Include Boost + Jumping
- Discord Auth through Ares
- All cars have no max speed, except ball holder
- Ball holder is always at least 10 speed units slower if not more
- Ball holder gets slower over time
- Hidden power up that changes goal position once per round
- Maximum Players - 24~
```

## Folder Structure
```text
ðŸ“‚ src            # Where the code lives
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ client         # Client-side
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ configs        # Folders with 'resource.cfg'
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ core           # Shared code (event names, etc)

```

_Do not put anything in the `resources` folder. It will be overwritten._
